# ComfyUI Deployment Builder - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

The ComfyUI Deployment Builder is a web application that streamlines the creation of automated ComfyUI installation scripts for cloud platforms like RunPod. It provides a curated database of custom nodes, models from CivitAI and HuggingFace, and generates deployment-ready scripts similar to existing manual configurations.
