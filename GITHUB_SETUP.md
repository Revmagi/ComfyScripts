# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right → "New repository"
3. Fill in repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `comfyui-deployment-builder`
   - **Description**: `A comprehensive web application for creating and managing automated ComfyUI installation scripts for cloud platforms like RunPod`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended for open source) or Private
   - **Do NOT initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

4. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/comfyui-deployment-builder.git

# Push your local code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Configure Repository Settings

### Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - ✅ Include administrators

### Repository Topics/Tags
Add these topics for discoverability:
- `comfyui`
- `stable-diffusion`
- `deployment`
- `automation`
- `runpod`
- `nextjs`
- `typescript`
- `ai-art`

### Repository Description
Use this description:
```
A comprehensive web application for creating and managing automated ComfyUI installation scripts for cloud platforms like RunPod. Features curated databases of custom nodes and models from CivitAI and HuggingFace with visual deployment builder.
```

## Step 4: Set Up GitHub Issues

I'll create issue templates for you. After pushing to GitHub, create these issues to track development:

### Milestones to Create:
1. **Phase 1: Foundation** (8 weeks)
2. **Phase 2: Advanced Features** (8 weeks)  
3. **Phase 3: Polish & Advanced** (8 weeks)
4. **Phase 4: Production & Scaling** (8 weeks)

### Issue Labels to Create:
- `enhancement` - New features
- `bug` - Bug reports
- `documentation` - Documentation updates
- `api-integration` - External API work
- `database` - Database related
- `ui/ux` - User interface work
- `security` - Security related
- `performance` - Performance improvements
- `phase-1`, `phase-2`, `phase-3`, `phase-4` - Development phases

## Step 5: GitHub Actions (Future)

Create `.github/workflows/` directory for CI/CD:
- `ci.yml` - Run tests and linting
- `deploy.yml` - Deploy to production
- `security.yml` - Security scans

## Commands to Run After Creating GitHub Repository

```bash
# Verify Git setup
git status
git log --oneline

# Add GitHub remote (replace with your username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/comfyui-deployment-builder.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Verify push was successful
git status
```

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. ✅ Repository created and code pushed
2. ⏳ Set up GitHub Issues and milestones
3. ⏳ Configure branch protection
4. ⏳ Add repository topics and description
5. ⏳ Start Phase 1 development

Your repository will be ready for collaborative development once these steps are complete!
